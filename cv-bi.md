Hello,

I'm contacting you to express my interest in your Drupal Developer position. I actually contracted with Boston Interactive a few years ago as a Drupal developer and did the initial build out for one of your clients (uTest) and had a great time working with your team - although I think several of the people I worked with have moved on.

Since then, I've been working at a small firm near South Station, Brunello Creative. As the Senior Drupal Developer I've been able to grow professionally into all realms of web development including Linux server administration, front end development (including CSS preprocessors and frameworks and well as Javascript and the jQuery framework), source control, and of course Drupal Development.

However, Brunello Creative is a very small team and after spending close to four great years there, I'd like to move on. The primary reason is that I'd like the chance to interact with more senior developers. While we have a great team at Brunello, I've always been the most senior and experienced developer. I'd like the chance to learn from developers who are my peers and also developers who are senior to me. I know from my previous experience with Boston Interactive that you have that kind of team.

If I remember correctly, Boston Interactive's concentration was primarily with ASP and Windows Technology. I'm interested to find out if you're looking to start a team of Drupal/PHP developers, add to a team that has been established since I last worked with you, or just add a singe Drupal/PHP developer and how I might fit into your plan.

Sincerely, 
Adam Balsam
